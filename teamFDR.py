"""
teamfdr.py creates s Fixture Difficulty ratings (FDRs) for each team based on the statistical quality of their performances in the last two seasons. It is the core of my project, and the most mathematical part of the model. I give each team 4 multipliers from 0 based on their performances at attacking and defending at home and away, and use this to determine mean forcasted goals in a fixture. The most significant problem to be solved is how to accurately map form, which will be discussed.
